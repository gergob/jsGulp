Task Automation - Building with Gulp

If you want to follow along the blog post, you don't have to do any installation. But if you want to start using the complete Gulp file immediately, you have to do two things.

* The sources assume you have Gulp installed globally:
  ```
  npm install gulp-cli -g
  ```
* After this, you have to install the dependecies:
  ```
  npm install
  ```
